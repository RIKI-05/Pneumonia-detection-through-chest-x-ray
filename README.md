 ## :diamonds: DESCRIPTION
Chest X-ray imaging is the most frequently used method for diagnosing pneumonia. However, the examination of chest X-rays is a challenging task and is prone to subjective variability. We have used a powerful dataset having more than 500 chest x-rays and trained the machine learining model to test the testing data set.
The image classification model is giving accurate results.
